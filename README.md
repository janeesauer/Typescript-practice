# TypeScript Katas

TypeScript Language Track Day 1

## Introduction

This series of challenges is designed to get you used to coding in TypeScript. Please be cognisant of the various ways TypeScript lets you write your code, but try to focus on the most type-safe alternative.

## Setup

This repo uses mocha and chai for testing. Please see the links below to the docs if you need to reference them:

- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/)

Don't forget to use the `.ts` extension on all code files :)

See individual readmes for details about the challenges.

## How to Approach

When getting started with these TypeScript katas try to follow the following process:

- Think about the inputs and outputs of the function
- Build all necessary types needed for the function, bearing in mind the narrower the types the better!
- Test the behaviour of the function
