// The five SOLID principles are:

// Single responsibility principle: a class should have one, and only one, reason to change;
// Open-closed principle: it should be possible to extend the behavoir of a class without  modifying it;
// Liskov Substitution principle: subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses;
// Interface segregation principle: many small, client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface;
// Dependency inversion principle: depends on abstractions not concretions;

// These principles, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain 
// and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, 
// easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
